## Virtual Psychologist Asisted by AI

### General description
memo Ai is a virtual psychologist that uses artificial inteligence to process user's voice and develop answers in audio format as if it was a real interaction, providing a really fluid experience that's accessible and affordable for everyone. Its main objective is to prevent suicides and give some company to those who are in need because of a stressful, sad, or hard situation. If the AI detects possibilities that the user could harm himself by analizing their voice and words, it will immediatly call its emergency contact for it to help the user as soon as possible. This call has a personalized message depending on the user in risk, which can help the people answering to identify the person in risk.
